> ### 🪶 This is the **lite, open-source edition** of [**AcademiCats**](https://academicats.com)
> The full product at **[academicats.com](https://academicats.com)** is an AI research workbench that takes you from *finding* papers all the way through *reading, writing, and self-review* — with Google Scholar breadth, Chinese-language sources, saved libraries, a polished UI, and a multi-agent reviewer. This skill is a free, self-contained slice of that workflow you can run on your own Claude.

## ✨ What it does

🔍 **Search that means it** — one question fans out across five scholarly databases (OpenAlex, Crossref, arXiv, Semantic Scholar, Europe PMC), de-duplicates, and ranks by genuine research fit — not just keyword overlap.

📄 **Read, not skim** — pick any open-access paper and it resolves the PDF, extracts the text, and gives you a structured, page-anchored reading: the research question, method, key findings, and limitations.

🛡️ **No made-up papers, no made-up findings** — every result is a real record from a public API, and every reading is built only from the actual extracted text. When a paper is paywalled, it says so — it never invents the contents.

<br>

## 🎬 Demo

Ask in plain language:

> *"Find me papers on CRISPR off-target effects."*

First it shows a quick **search setup** so you stay in control — same on any model:

> 🔍 **Search setup** — confirm or tweak, then I'll run it:
> 1. **Topic** — CRISPR off-target effects
> 2. **How many papers** — 20  *(10 / 20 / 40)*
> 3. **Years** — any  *(e.g. 2020–2026)*
> 4. **Open-access only** — no  *(yes / no)*
> 5. **Sort by** — best match  *(best match / newest / most cited / open access)*
>
> Reply with any changes, or just say **go**.

Then it returns a **numbered list of every result** — one scannable line each, so you can act on any of them by number. The format is fixed by the tool, identical no matter which model runs the skill:

> ## 🔎 5 results for: CRISPR off-target effects
> 1. **[Off-target effects in CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing](https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2023.1143157)** — Congting Guo et al. · 2023 · cited 537 · 🟢 · [PDF](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2023.1143157/pdf)
> 2. **[Latest Developed Strategies to Minimize Off-Target Effects in CRISPR-Cas Genome Editing](https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9071608)** — Naeem et al. · 2020 · cited 451 · 🟢 · [PDF](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/9/7/1608/pdf)
> 3. **[CRISPR/Cas Systems in Genome Editing: sgRNA Design & Off‑Target Evaluation](https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.201902312)** — Manghwar et al. · 2020 · cited 357 · 🟢 · [PDF](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/advs.201902312)
> 4. **[CRISPR/Cas13 effectors have differing off-target effects in eukaryotic cells](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkac159)** — Ai et al. · 2022 · cited 151 · 🔒
> 5. **[Beyond the promise: evaluating & mitigating off-target effects for safer therapeutics](https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2023.1339189)** — Lopes et al. · 2024 · cited 62 · 🟢

Every title links straight to the paper; 🟢 means a free PDF you can read in full. Then just say **"deep-read #1"** — it opens that paper's PDF and reads it back to you with findings tied to page numbers, grounded entirely in the paper's own text.

## 🚀 Get started in 60 seconds

```bash
# 1. install into Claude Code's skills folder
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/jy1529098645-gif/Cat_paper_search.git ~/.claude/skills/paper-search

# 2. install the one dependency (Python 3.8+, for reading PDFs)
cd ~/.claude/skills/paper-search && python -m pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

Restart Claude Code so it loads the skill. From then on, just talk to Claude — *"find recent papers on …"*, *"summarise this arXiv paper …"* — and it triggers itself. Everything runs on your own Claude; all data sources are free and need no API keys.

**On Claude web or desktop instead?** Download **[`paper-search.skill`](paper-search.skill)** and upload it under **Settings → Capabilities → Skills** — then just ask in any chat. (Its search & PDF scripts run in Claude's built-in code sandbox.)

## 🐱 The AcademiCats skill family

Three open skills that chain into one research workflow — install any or all:

- 🔍 **Paper Search** *(you are here)* — find & read papers
- ✍️ [Synthesis Lab](https://github.com/jy1529098645-gif/Cat_synthesis_lab) — write grounded papers from your sources
- 🧪 [Paper Review](https://github.com/jy1529098645-gif/Cat_paper_review) — peer-review your own draft

**Install all three at once** — clone any one repo, then run `bash install.sh`.

## 🙋 FAQ

- **It didn't trigger?** Restart Claude Code after installing, and phrase your message as a task — *"find recent papers on …"*.
- **A paper won't open?** It's paywalled with no free copy — the skill says so instead of guessing. Try another result, or paste a DOI / PDF link.
- **Why fewer than 5 databases sometimes?** Semantic Scholar rate-limits key-free traffic. It auto-retries, and the other 4 databases carry the search — or grab a free [S2 API key](https://www.semanticscholar.org/product/api) and `export S2_API_KEY=...` to always include it.
- **Which model?** Any model works; quality is best on Claude Sonnet or above.
- **Private & free?** It runs on your own Claude — no account, nothing sent to us. Searches only hit public scholarly APIs.
