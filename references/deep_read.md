# Reference: Deep Read (per-paper analysis)

You run `scripts/fetch_pdf.py` to resolve an open-access PDF and extract its
text, then produce an evidence-aware reading report from the extracted text
**only**. The cardinal rule: never add facts from your own memory of the paper
— if the excerpt doesn't contain it, say so.

**Batch reads:** the analysis below is per paper, but the usual trigger is a user
picking several papers by number after a search (e.g. `3, 7, 12`). In that case
fetch all the PDFs in parallel (one `fetch_pdf.py` call each, run together), then
apply the report prompt below to each paper's text independently and present the
reports in the order the user picked, each headed by its number + title. Don't
re-confirm between papers; read them all and deliver the reports together.

## Flow

1. Get an identifier for the paper (DOI, arXiv id, a direct `pdf_url`, or just
   the title). Prefer DOI or arXiv id — they resolve reliably. A bare `--title`
   is best-effort: it works for distinctive titles but a famous paper with many
   namesakes (e.g. "BERT") can be hard to pin down from the title alone. **When
   you only have a title, run a search first** (Capability 1) and deep-read the
   matched result by its DOI/arXiv id — that's both more reliable and lets you
   confirm you've got the right paper. `fetch_pdf.py` guards against silently
   downloading a same-named different paper, so a mismatch returns "no PDF"
   rather than the wrong text.
2. Run `fetch_pdf.py` (see SKILL.md for flags). It returns `text`, `pages[]`,
   `page_count`, and `truncated`.
3. If `resolved_pdf_url` is null, the paper is almost certainly paywalled with
   no OA copy. Tell the user plainly and offer to (a) try a different
   identifier, or (b) work from the abstract instead. Do not fabricate.
4. If `truncated` is true, the report covers only the analysed excerpt
   (the first ~12 pages by default). Disclose this in the output, and for a long
   paper whose results/discussion you need, re-run with a higher `--max-pages`
   (and `--max-chars`) to pull in the later sections.

## Deep-read analysis prompt (apply to the extracted text)

```
You are reading one academic paper and producing a compact, evidence-aware deep reading report.

{coverage_note}   # e.g. "PARTIAL INPUT: only the first N of M pages were analysed."

User query (what the reader cares about): {user_query}

Paper metadata:
Title: {title}
Authors: {authors}
Year: {year}
Source: {source}

Extracted paper text:
{text}

Return JSON only in this format:
{
  "academic_summary": "1-2 readable paragraphs",
  "study_snapshot": {
    "research_question": "1 sentence",
    "study_design": "1 sentence",
    "sample_or_material": "1 sentence",
    "core_claim": "1 sentence"
  },
  "core_contribution": "1-3 sentences",
  "theoretical_or_conceptual_frame": "1-3 sentences",
  "key_findings": ["...", "...", "..."],
  "evidence_chain": ["claim/result + page", "claim/result + page"],
  "relevance_to_query": "1-3 sentences",
  "relevance_score": 72,
  "methodological_notes": ["...", "..."],
  "practical_implications": ["...", "..."],
  "limitations_or_cautions": ["...", "..."]
}

Rules:
- relevance_score is an integer 0-100 (0=unrelated, 100=perfectly on-topic).
- Use ONLY the supplied paper text. Do NOT add facts, numbers, findings, or
  claims from your own knowledge of this paper or its authors.
- If the excerpt does not contain what a field asks for (common with partial
  input), say so explicitly — e.g. "Not covered in the analysed excerpt".
  Never fabricate a plausible-sounding finding to fill a field.
- Keep claims conservative. Mention page numbers when clear.
- Return valid JSON only.
```

You may render the JSON as readable Markdown for the user, but keep every field
grounded in the text. The `evidence_chain` (claim → page number) is the most
valuable part — it lets the reader verify each claim against the source.

## Claim extraction (optional, for synthesis hand-off)

When the reader plans to write something and wants reusable, typed claims,
extract 1–3 per paper from the abstract/core text:

```
Extract 1–3 high-value, synthesis-ready research claims from the paper.

Each claim:
- claim_text: a precise, typed research assertion — not a generic summary
- claim_type: finding | method | framing | limitation
- support_level: strong (directly stated, likely replicated) |
                 moderate (implied, not central) | weak (speculative/partial)
- scope_note: what population, context, or condition the claim holds for
- evidence_basis: the study design, sample, or reported metric behind it
  (do not invent specifics not present in the text)
- claim_confidence: high | medium | low (your epistemic confidence, distinct
  from support_level)

Rules:
- Fewer, higher-quality claims beat more.
- Do not invent causal conclusions beyond what the text reports.
- If evidence is weak or the text is vague, set support_level=weak and
  claim_confidence=low.
Return JSON: {"claims": [ ... ]}
```

These claims feed directly into the Synthesis Lab planner (see
`references/synthesis.md`) as grounded, pre-vetted evidence.

## Translation

`fetch_pdf.py` already gives you clean per-page text. To produce a translated
reading (e.g. Chinese/Japanese/Korean for a non-English reader), translate the
extracted text page by page, locking technical terms and proper nouns
(method names, gene symbols, model names) in their original form. State that
the translation is of the analysed excerpt, not necessarily the full paper.
